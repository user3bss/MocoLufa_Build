# MocoLufa_Build

Test_sketch adapted from Midi Example
you'll need Midi Arduino Library installed which is available at

https://github.com/FortySevenEffects/arduino_midi_library/releases/latest



Arduino MocoLufa Builds Mega2560 and Uno and Leonardo

I havent personally tested leonardo or uno, but it should work

due has 2 ports the native port can be used for midi host or midi device
if you search for the code. I think midi slave is built into arduino codebase
